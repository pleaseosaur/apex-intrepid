# Apex Intrepid

_A Unity-based fusion of roguelike shooter and tower defense developed by Andrew Cox, Mason Yonkers, and Evan Asche at Western Washington University._

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Apex Intrepid** is a sci-fi survival game where you play as a rogue robot escaping from a hive mind that once controlled you. Now hunted by your former collective, your only means of survival is to strategically build turrets from enemy parts to fend off waves of relentless bots.

This project was built as a final group assignment for **CSCI 321: Game Programming (Summer 2024)**. The game emphasizes strategic turret placement, real-time survival mechanics, and adaptive AI in a futuristic setting.

## 🧠 Gameplay Summary

- Survive continuous waves of enemy bots using turret-based defense
- Place and upgrade turrets using enemy drops and in-game currency
- Navigate increasingly difficult levels, ending in a final boss fight
- Pick up buffs and modifiers to stay alive in fast-paced enemy encounters

## 📣 Sales Pitch (aka TL;DR)

> You are a defected robot, hunted by the hive that once controlled you. You can’t shoot. You can’t punch. All you can do… is build. Construct turrets from the parts of your enemies. Place them wisely. Survive the horde. Escape the hive.
