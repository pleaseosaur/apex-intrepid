Changing Colors
If you are familiar with 2D photo editing software such as Photoshop or GIMP; you can use the included masks inside the textures folder to modify the textures colors.

Additionally, if you already own a license of Substance 3D Painter wich is an external paid software and not a Unity Plugin; you could use the included Substance Painter files to export any new textures you need.

Thank you for your purchase and feel free to ask any question at our support thread.
